## About me

I'm studying at The Net Value Academy to become a junior full stack developer. Also, I'm a novice cybersecurity self-taught.
Actually, I only know C programming language. In the next few months, I'll learn how to program with Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python and C# and how to use various framework like Laravel,
Bootstrap, Angular, etc...
